#### Technical Skills Used
* Java and Eclipse IDE
* Enumerated Types (Enums)
* Object-Oriented design
* Encapsulation (getter methods)
* Collection (Lists)
* Polymorphism / Inheritance
* Constructor methods
* For loops and while loops
* User input with Scanner

#### How to Run
This program runs on Eclipse and ...

#### Lessons Learned
I have learned how Polymorphism and Inheritance coexist and we cannot have the former without the latter. I became more comfortable with the instanceof() operator to use a superclass's methods to perform a task for its subclass, as well as the BufferedReader and FileReader to utilize a text file's data for a Java application.
