# _Blackjack_

### Overview
This application simulates a Blackjack casino game wherein the user can play a variant of the card game blackjack against the dealer ( _computer_ ).

### Game Rules
The player ( _you_ ) initially receives two cards and can interact by deciding whether to _stand_ or _hit_ until the _total value_ of their cards reaches 21 or they bust. The user can play as many rounds as they wish, until they choose to exit the application.

### Technologies Used
* Java / JEE
* Object-Oriented design:
  * Inheritance & Polymorphism
  * Encapsulation
  * Abstraction
* Collection Types (Lists)
* Conditionals & loops
* Java's Scanner ( _user interaction_ )

### How to Run
You'll need a basic editor ( Eclipse, VS Code ) with installed extensions for JDK ( _Java_ ). Then Git Clone the source code into a file ( _usually done through your local terminal_ ). Open the saved file in your editor and access the Console tab ( _Eclipse_ ) or Terminal window ( _VS Code_ ) and run the application as a Java app. Your actions ( _moves_ ) are performed by typing input on your keyboard for a menu selection.

##### tl;dr

Any IDE with JDK installed and a CLI

### Lessons Learned ( _Object-Oriented-Programming_ )
One of my 1st projects, _Blackjack_ drilled-in key OOP fundamentals & significance of Polymorphism and Inheritance; how they coexist and we cannot have the former without the latter.

I learned how to properly design the class structure of Object-Oriented Programming; more specifically, how to utilize several Java directories and multiple classes within those directories to reinforce encapsulation and appropriate organization. Additionally, I learned that when designing an application that involves multiple method-interactions between objects from different classes, whether in the same Java package or not, it is helpful to pass the objects themselves into the methods' parameters, rather than instantiate those objects within each method. This is to ensure that the application's various classes and methods are referring to the same object in memory.
